1) You need to download "Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17"
2) You need to set the SQL server name to your own PC name ( this can be found by going Windows Search Box > "About my PC" > look for "Device name") and put that in the SQL server name
3) Go to the ....OOP Resub\Drews_Goods\Drew's Goods\App.config and change where it sais "DGPC" to your Device name from earlier (e.g KatiePC)
4) run the SQL server
5) launch the software
6) Login with:
Username: Drew
Password: drewsgoods

I have also included a .mp4 file AND a youtube upload link showing the help page I have added to cover the P6 criteria however, so you don't need to do any of this hassle!

Thanks.
